ðŸ“• &nbsp;**My Opensource Story**
All of my projects are released as open-source on GitHub:
- [Nerdware](https://github.com/JHenriqueSousa/nerdware) - An Open Source project created from scratch, thinking about what would fit best for the community. Nerdware is a powerful, consistent, and flexible ecommerce platform. Built using the RainTpl and Slim frameworks, Nerdware provides a simple yet highly extensible architecture that encourages companies to start selling Online.
- [ReparoCellars](https://github.com/JHenriqueSousa/reparocellars) - My first Open Source app, a repair manager, that can fit all types of companies.
